## Type 

 - [ ] General question or discussion
 - [ ] Propose a brand new feature
 - [ ] Request modification of existing behavior or design

## What is the problem that your feature request solves
<!--
e.g. I need to be able to archive spanish and french subtitle files  
from a particular <example.com> movie site that's going down soon.
-->

## Describe the ideal specific solution you'd want, and whether it fits into any broader scope of changes
<!--
e.g. I specifically need a new archive method to look for multilingual subtitle files related to pages.  
The bigger picture solution is the ability for custom user scripts to be run in a puppeteer context during archiving.
-->

## What hacks or alternative solutions have you tried to solve the problem?
<!--
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions,

## How badly do you want this new feature?

 - [ ] It's an urgent deal-breaker, I can't live without it

 - [ ] It would be nice to have eventually

 - [ ] I like ArchiveBox so far / would recommend it to a friend
 - [ ] I've had a lot of difficulty getting ArchiveBox set up
